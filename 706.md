Blurb:

> Sturgill Simpson has all the makings of a classic country star, complete with an upbringing in coal country, a job on the railroad, and the stamp of approval by country music legends. But as Sturgill tells Marc, he's not interested in being country's savior. He just likes making music, especially for his son. Also, Marc plays a little teaser clip of his upcoming interview with John C. Reilly, in which they talk about John's crazy new futuristic movie The Lobster. This episode is sponsored by Preacher on AMC, Squarespace and Blue Apron.
